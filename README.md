This Rust program computes the order of an element (a,b) \in Z_n^* \times Z_m^*, where Z_n^* and Z_m^* are multiplicative groups. 
The order of an element in this direct product is the least common multiple of the orders of a in Z_n^* and b in Z_m^*. 
This order is the smallest positive integer k such that (a^k, b^k) = (1, 1).
